# CS_Showcase

This is a repository for my computer science data structures class.  All code in this respository is original to myself and my teammate, Parker Hubbard.

Data-types
===
Under the data-types folder, you will find our header files which contain abstract classes that attempt to model these standard data types found in the STL.  

Implementations
===
Under the implementations folder, you will find our source files that were required projects we had to create for this class, using the very data type header files that we created in the data-types folder.  

Notes
===
It should be noted that this repository is currently live, as the semester is not yet over, and I am still working on it.
By no means is this code perfect, but this code passed 100% of all unit test cases.
