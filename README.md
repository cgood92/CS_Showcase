# CS_Showcase

This is my repository for my computer science data structures class.  All code in this respository is original to myself and my teammate, Parker Hubbard.  Each folder contains a week's project, and each project included creating our own "dataType.h" file, as well as a challenege using that data type.  Testing files, for unit case testing, were created by my professor, and are included here.
Notes
===
It should be noted that this repository is currently live, as the semester is not yet over, and I am still working on it.
