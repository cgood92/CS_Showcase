# Data-Structures-C++

This is a repository for my computer science data structures class.  All code in this respository is original to myself and my teammate, Parker Hubbard.

Data-types
===
Under the data-types folder, you will find our header files which contain abstract classes that attempt to model these standard data types found in the STL.  

Implementations
===
Under the implementations folder, you will find our source files that were required projects we had to create for this class, using the very data type header files that we created in the data-types folder.  

Notes
===
By no means is this code perfect, but this code passed 100% of all unit test cases provided by the instructor.  Specific requirements were designed by the class and the instructor
